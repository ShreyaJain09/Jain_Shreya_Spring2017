Aye?\\nDAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?\\nJACK SPARROW: Yep! I\\'m good with it. Should we seal it in blood?

I always heard it said Kray-kin. \\nRAGETTI: What, with a long A? \\nPINTEL: Aye.\\nRAGETTI: No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

Well... you\\'re welcome, then.\\nELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!\\nJACK SPARROW: Pretty much.

What\\'re you doing?\\nWILL TURNER: I\\'m gonna kill Jones.\\n[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]\\nJACK SPARROW: Can\\'t let you do that, William. \\'Cause if Jones is dead, who\\'s to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

And Turner there - I figure \\'e\\'s tryna... settle some unresolved business \\'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father. \\nPINTEL: Sad.
